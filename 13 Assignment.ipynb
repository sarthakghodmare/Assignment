    "soln:An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs are used to enable the integration of different systems, applications, and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Aspects of APIs:\n",
    "Endpoints: URLs where the API can be accessed.\n",
    "Requests and Responses: How data is requested from and sent to the API.\n",

    "1.Client:\n",
    "The client is typically the application or interface used by the end-user to interact with the online banking system. It could be a mobile banking app or a web-based banking portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Mobile Banking App\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**:\n",
    "   - **API**: General interface for software communication.\n",
    "   - **Web API**: API specifically for web-based interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Protocol**:\n",
    "   - **API**: Can use various protocols.\n",
    "   - **Web API**: Uses HTTP/HTTPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Format**:\n",
    "   - **API**: Can use various formats.\n",
    "   - **Web API**: Typically uses JSON or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Access**:\n",
    "   - **API**: May be local or network-based.\n",
    "   - **Web API**: Accessed over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Usage**:\n",
    "   - **API**: Broad applications, including local systems.\n",
    "   - **Web API**: Focused on web services and clients.\n",

    "Architecture Style: Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations.\n",
    "Stateless: Each request contains all necessary information.\n",
    "Resource-Based: Interacts with resources identified by URLs.\n",
    "Data Formats: Typically JSON or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)\n",
    "Protocol: Uses XML for messaging and can rely on HTTP, SMTP, etc.\n",

    "Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.\n",
    "### Differences Between REST and SOAP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Protocol**:\n",
    "   - **REST**: Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
    "   - **SOAP**: Can use multiple protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and others, but XML is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Message Format**:\n",
    "   - **REST**: Typically uses lightweight formats like JSON or XML.\n",
    "   - **SOAP**: Uses XML for all messages, which can be more verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statefulness**:\n",
    "   - **REST**: Stateless; each request from the client must contain all necessary information.\n",
    "   - **SOAP**: Can be either stateless or stateful; supports maintaining state across multiple requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Complexity**:\n",
    "   - **REST**: Simpler and more lightweight, making it easier to use and implement.\n",
    "   - **SOAP**: More complex due to its strict standards and extensive protocol support.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - **REST**: Relies on standard HTTP status codes for error handling.\n",
    "   - **SOAP**: Uses standardized fault elements in XML messages to provide detailed error information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Security**:\n",
    "   - **REST**: Relies on HTTPS for security; additional security measures are implemented at the application level.\n",
    "   - **SOAP**: Includes built-in standards for security (WS-Security), providing a comprehensive security model.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Performance**:\n",
    "   - **REST**: Generally faster and more efficient due to its lightweight nature and use of JSON.\n",
    "   - **SOAP**: Can be slower due to the overhead of XML and additional protocol features.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Flexibility**:\n",
    "   - **REST**: Highly flexible, allowing different data formats and more adaptable to various needs.\n",
    "   - **SOAP**: Less flexible due to its strict protocol requirements and XML-based messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **REST**: Simple, lightweight, uses HTTP, JSON/XML, stateless.\n",
    "- **SOAP**: Complex, uses multiple protocols, XML-based, can be stateful."
